# AdaptorDesignPattern
Adaptor Design Pattern example in C#

The adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces. This sort of design is structured as this pattern combines the capacity of two separate interfaces.

This pattern includes a single class that combines separate or incompatible interfaces. An example for real life may be a card reader that functions as a memory card-laptop converter. You put the memory card into the card reader and into your laptop so that you may read the memory card via your laptop.
